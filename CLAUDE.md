# Grang Studio — Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

Personal portfolio website for **Kang Bosun (강보선)**, photographer and video director, operating under the studio name **Grang Studio**. The site is a showcase for potential clients and companies to view her work.

- **Site name:** Grang Studio
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Next.js)
- **Navigation style:** Single-page / SPA with anchor-based section navigation

## Person

- **Name:** Kang Bosun (강보선), born 1999.05.14
- **Role:** Photographer & Video Director (포토그래퍼, 영상 디렉터)
- **Location:** Seongsu-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul
- **Email:** wolfkang0514@naver.com
- **Phone:** 010-6401-0514
- **Education:** Sangmyung University — Photography & Video Content, B.A. (2018–2022), GPA 3.63/4.5
- **Profile photo:** `notion_export/bosun_portfolio/non_folderized/증명사진.jpeg`

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Theme:** `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`, default `system`
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (scroll reveals, fade-ins — subtle and purposeful)
- **Images:** `next/image` for all photos (WebP, lazy loading, responsive sizing)
- **Video:** YouTube embed (no YouTube branding if possible — use `youtube-nocookie.com`)
- **No UI component library** — all components hand-crafted for a unique artistic feel

## Design Principles

- **The work is everything** — images and videos are the entire point; UI exists only to serve them
- **Minimal and purposeful** — whitespace is intentional, not empty; nothing decorative that doesn't serve the art
- **No résumé elements** — no skills bars, no career timelines, no award badges, no tech stack displays
- **Scroll as experience** — transitions between sections should feel intentional and atmospheric, not mechanical
- **Animations: subtle and cool** — entrance reveals, smooth fades, parallax where appropriate; never distracting
- **Typography-forward** — large, expressive type carries the identity; used sparingly
- **Dark theme:** cinematic — near-black backgrounds, high contrast on imagery, moody atmosphere
- **Light theme:** editorial/print — off-white, clean negative space, gallery-wall feeling
- **No generic patterns** — no cards with drop shadows, no rounded-everything, no stock portfolio layouts

## Theme System

- Library: `next-themes`
- Strategy: `attribute="class"` on `<html>`
- Default: `system` (auto-detects OS preference, no flash on load)
- Toggle: icon-only button (sun/moon) in the navigation — no label
- Persist user selection in localStorage (handled automatically by `next-themes`)

## Design Variants

The site ships with **3 distinct design variants** so the client can compare and choose. A variant switcher UI element (separate from the light/dark toggle) lets the viewer cycle between them in real time.

**Purpose:** client preview and selection — the chosen variant becomes the final production design.

**Architecture:**
- Active variant stored in a `data-design` attribute on `<html>` (e.g. `data-design="v1"`)
- Each variant is a set of CSS custom properties scoped to `[data-design="v1"]` etc.
- Light/dark theme and design variant are fully independent — each variant works in both themes
- Variant choice persisted in `localStorage` alongside theme preference
- Switcher component: small, unobtrusive — positioned bottom-right or top-right of nav, labeled `V1 / V2 / V3`
- **Extensible by design** — adding V4 means adding a CSS block and a new switcher option; no structural changes needed

**The 3 variants:**
| Variant | File | Personality | Display Font | Accent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | `designs/v1-minimal.md` | Cinematic / Gold — dark/moody, Bebas, dramatic scale | Bebas Neue | Gold `#C8A96E` |
| V2 | `designs/v2-cinematic.md` | Embers / Copper — warm earth tones, copper accent | Bebas Neue | Copper `#C1714A` |
| V3 | `designs/v3-editorial.md` | Slate / Contemporary — geometric Syne font, cool slate-blue | Syne | Slate `#6B8CAE` |

**Hero image rule:** All three variants use `public/images/cosmetics/foundation-1.jpg` as a subtle full-bleed background (opacity ≈ 0.12). Placed with `next/image fill + object-cover + priority`, `absolute inset-0`. It is atmospheric texture, not a dominant image — type and content remain primary.

Each variant's full spec (colors, fonts, spacing, animation style, layout details) lives in its own file under `designs/`. CLAUDE.md does not duplicate that detail here.

## Responsive Breakpoints

Mobile-first. Three layouts:
- **Mobile:** < 640px — single column, stacked nav
- **Tablet:** 640–1024px — 2-column gallery, horizontal nav
- **Desktop:** > 1024px — 3-column gallery, full nav

## Site Structure (Single Page, Anchor Nav)

```
/ (single page)
├── #hero          — Full-viewport atmospheric opener: name + role, minimal type, entrance animation
├── #photography   — Main gallery: filterable photo grid, the heart of the site
├── #video         — Video work: embedded YouTube, cinematic presentation
├── #design        — 2D / graphic design work: poster and illustration grid
└── #info          — Bottom of page: short one-line bio, email, Instagram — nothing more
```

**What this site is not:** a résumé. No skills, no career timeline, no awards section, no education. Viewers are here to experience the work.

**Branding rule — studio over person:** The site presents **Grang Studio** as the brand, not Kang Bosun as an individual. The photographer's name appears only once, in the minimal Info section at the bottom. Everywhere else — hero, nav wordmark, page title, metadata — the identity is "Grang Studio". Do not foreground the person's name in any section heading, hero, or prominent UI element.

Navigation: wordmark left, section links center, theme toggle right. Links scroll to anchors smoothly. Active section indicated subtly (not aggressively highlighted).

## Portfolio Content

### Photography Projects

All source images are in `notion_export/bosun_portfolio/non_folderized/`.
When building, copy to `public/images/<category>/` using clean English filenames.
Prefer `_크게` (large) versions over `_복사` (copy) versions where both exist.

| Category | Key | Image Count | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cosmetics | `cosmetics` | 12 | Beauty/skincare product photography |
| Watch | `watch` | 5 | Watch product shots incl. PRX model |
| Glass | `glass` | 3 | Perfume bottles, glass objects |
| Glasses Cutout | `glasses` | 3 | Clean background eyewear shots |
| Vase | `vase` | 2 | Still life |
| Portrait | `portrait` | 6 | 3 subjects, large + web-res pairs |
| Light Painting | `light-painting` | 5 | Long exposure light art |
| AI Work | `ai-work` | 4 | AI-generated portrait composites |
| Fine Art | `fine-art` | 7 | Fine art series (순수_강보선 + behind) |
| Assignment | `assignment` | 4 | University assignment work |
| Airbnb Interior | `airbnb` | 5 | Airbnb listing interior photography |
| RISE Campus Interior | `rise-interior` | 5 | Language school campus |
| RISE Website Images | `rise-website` | 10 | Commercial: students, teachers, classrooms |

**Gallery groupings for UI filter tabs:**
- All
- Still Life (cosmetics, watch, glass, glasses, vase) — filter key: `product`
- Portrait
- Fine Art (fine-art, light-painting, assignment)
- AI (ai-work) — filter key: `ai`
- Interior (airbnb, rise-interior, rise-website)

```

## Content Data Pattern

All portfolio content lives in `src/lib/portfolio.ts` as typed arrays — no CMS needed.

```ts
// Example shape
type Project = {
  id: string
  title: string
  category: Category
  images: string[]   // paths relative to /public/images/
  featured?: boolean
}
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # production build
npm run lint     # ESLint
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

## Git Conventions

- Branch: `main`
- Remote: `git@github.com:devheesukang/grangstudio.git`
- Commit format: `type: description` (feat, fix, style, content, refactor, chore)
- Examples: `feat: add photography gallery filter`, `content: add watch project images`

### Commit & Push Workflow

**Commits and pushes only happen during active phase execution — never during planning.**

During a phase, commit + push at every meaningful milestone. Rule of thumb: if a component works independently, commit it. Never batch multiple completed components into one commit.

**Within a phase, commit + push after each:**
- New component is built and renders correctly
- Dependency install or config change
- Image organization batch (per category)
- Content data file created or updated

**Before every commit during a phase:**
1. Tick the completed checklist items in CLAUDE.md (`[ ]` → `[x]`)
2. Stage CLAUDE.md alongside the other changed files
3. The commit message should reflect what was just completed

**Always push immediately after committing:**
```bash
git add <specific files> CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "type: description

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

Never use `git add .` or `git add -A` — always stage specific files to avoid accidentally committing sensitive files or build artifacts.

## Deployment

- Platform: Vercel
- Auto-deploy on push to `main`
- No environment variables required at launch (no CMS, no auth)

## Build Phases

Phases are completed sequentially. Each ends with a git commit. Check off tasks as done.

### Phase 1 — Foundation [x]
> Goal: establish the full visual and technical base. Everything else inherits from this.

- [x] Scaffold Next.js 14+ project (`npx create-next-app@latest .` — TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router, src dir)
- [x] Add `notion_export/` to `.gitignore` (98MB source dump — not for version control)
- [x] Install dependencies: `next-themes`, `framer-motion`
- [x] Implement design variant system: `data-design` attribute on `<html>`, CSS custom properties per variant, `localStorage` persistence
- [x] Configure Tailwind: custom font variables, color tokens scoped per variant + theme, base spacing scale
- [x] Set up `next-themes` provider in root layout, `attribute="class"`, default `system`
- [x] Define global CSS: font imports for all 3 variants, CSS custom properties for all variant × theme combinations
- [x] Build `Nav` component: logo/wordmark left, anchor links center, theme toggle + variant switcher right — responsive (hamburger on mobile)
- [x] Build `ThemeToggle` component: sun/moon icon only, no label
- [x] Build `VariantSwitcher` component: V1 / V2 / V3 labels, cycles variants, persists to localStorage
- [x] Build `Footer` component: minimal — name, year, email
- [x] Verify light/dark + all 3 variants work in combination, no flash on load
- [x] Commit + push: `feat: phase 1 — foundation, theme system, design variants`

### Phase 2 — Hero [x]
> Checkpoint: review design direction before building remaining sections.

- [x] Build `Hero` section: full-viewport, atmospheric, name + role in large type, entrance animation
- [x] Confirm scroll transition from Hero into the next section feels intentional
- [x] Confirm responsive layout on mobile / tablet / desktop
- [x] Confirm light/dark rendering feels right (cinematic dark / editorial light)
- [x] **User review checkpoint** — approved: "Grang Studio" branding applied across all three variants
- [x] Commit: `feat: phase 2 — hero section`

### Phase 3 — Photography Gallery [x]
> Most complex phase. Requires image organization before wiring up the gallery.

- [x] Organize images: copy from `notion_export/bosun_portfolio/non_folderized/` into `public/images/<category>/` with clean English filenames (prefer `_크게` versions)
- [x] Write `src/lib/portfolio.ts`: typed `Project[]` array with all 13 photo categories, image paths, titles
- [x] Build `Photography` section with filter tab bar (All / Product / Portrait / Fine Art / Interior)
- [x] Build `GalleryGrid` component: responsive masonry or CSS grid (1→2→3 col)
- [x] Add scroll-reveal entrance animation on gallery items (Framer Motion)
- [x] Test all 13 categories filter correctly
- [x] Commit: `feat: phase 3 — photography gallery`

### Phase 4 — Video, Design, Info + Polish [x]
> Remaining sections. Bundle together then do final polish pass.

- [x] Build `Video` section: YouTube embed cards (`youtube-nocookie.com`), cinematic presentation, responsive
- [x] Build `Design` section: poster and illustration image grid
- [x] Build `Info` section: one-line bio, email — absolute minimum, bottom of page
- [x] Global scroll experience polish: section transitions, animation timing, spacing rhythm
- [x] Audit all responsive breakpoints (mobile / tablet / desktop)
- [x] Performance check: `next build`, verify image optimization, no layout shift
- [x] Commit: `feat: phase 4 — video, design, info, polish`

### Phase 5 — Deployment [x]
- [x] Connect repo to Vercel
- [x] Verify production build on Vercel preview URL
- [x] Commit: `chore: production deployment setup`

### Phase 6 — Client Edit Round 1 [x]
> Goal: apply first round of client-requested changes across design variants, gallery, and contact info.

**Variant rotation & new designs:**
- [x] Rotate variants: old V2 (Cinematic/Bebas/Gold) → new V1. Retire old V1 (Cormorant/Minimal) and V3 (Playfair/Editorial).
- [x] New V2 — "Embers" (Copper/Rust): Bebas Neue display + DM Sans body, accent `#C1714A`, light bg `#F6F1EC`, dark bg `#100907`
- [x] New V3 — "Slate" (Contemporary): **Syne** display (new font import) + DM Sans body, accent `#6B8CAE`, light bg `#F3F4F7`, dark bg `#080B10`
- [x] Add `Syne` to `src/app/layout.tsx` via `next/font/google`, expose as `--font-syne` variable
- [x] Update `src/app/globals.css`: rewrite all three `[data-design]` blocks with new palettes and font references
- [x] Update `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`: old HeroV2 → HeroV1, write new HeroV2 (Embers) and HeroV3 (Slate)
- [x] Update `designs/` spec files to reflect new variant personalities
- [x] Commit: `feat: rotate design variants — V1=cinematic-gold, V2=embers, V3=slate`

**Hero background image:**
- [x] Add `foundation-1.jpg` (`public/images/cosmetics/foundation-1.jpg`) as a subtle full-bleed background to all three hero variants
- [x] Use `next/image` with `fill` + `object-cover`, `priority` prop, opacity ≈ 0.12 (atmospheric, not dominant)
- [x] Place image layer behind all content divs using `absolute inset-0`
- [x] Commit: `feat: add hero background image to all variants`

**Gallery — filter labels & AI category:**
- [x] `src/lib/portfolio.ts`: rename `FILTER_LABELS.product` from `'Product'` → `'Still Life'`
- [x] `src/lib/portfolio.ts`: add `'ai'` to `FilterGroup` type and `FILTER_GROUPS`, add `FILTER_LABELS.ai: 'AI'`
- [x] `src/lib/portfolio.ts`: change `ai-work` project's `filterGroup` from `'fine-art'` → `'ai'`
- [x] `src/components/sections/Photography.tsx`: add `'ai'` to `FILTER_GROUPS` array (it reads the array to render tabs — no other change needed)
- [x] Commit: `feat: add AI filter tab, rename Product to Still Life`

**Gallery — hide behind images:**
- [x] `src/lib/portfolio.ts`: remove `fine-art-behind-1.jpg` and `fine-art-behind-2.jpg` from the `fine-art` project's `images` array (files stay on disk)
- [x] Commit: `content: hide fine-art behind images from gallery`

**Photography section — bigger text:**
- [x] `src/components/sections/Photography.tsx`: increase section label from `text-[9px]` to `text-xs` or `text-sm`
- [x] Increase filter button font from `text-[10px]` to `text-xs`, increase padding (`px-5 py-2` or similar)
- [x] Commit: `style: larger photography section heading and filter buttons`

**Info section — contact details:**
- [x] `src/components/sections/Info.tsx`: add `lowercase` class (or `style={{ textTransform: 'lowercase' }}`) to email `<a>` element
- [x] Add phone number `010-6401-0514` below email, same minimal style
- [x] Add Instagram row: gray Instagram SVG icon + `studio.grang` handle as `<a href="https://www.instagram.com/studio.grang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`, hover opacity
- [x] Commit: `feat: info section — lowercase email, phone, Instagram link`

**Image download protection:**
- [x] `src/components/ui/GalleryGrid.tsx`: add `onContextMenu={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` to each gallery item wrapper
- [x] Add `draggable={false}` to each `<Image>` component
- [x] Add transparent overlay `<div>` (`position: absolute, inset: 0, z-index: 1`) on each gallery item to intercept pointer events
- [x] Note: this is a deterrent — motivated users can still access images via DevTools
- [x] Commit: `feat: block right-click image download in gallery`

**CLAUDE.md update:**
- [x] Update variant table to reflect V1=Cinematic/Gold, V2=Embers/Copper, V3=Slate/Syne
- [x] Update gallery groupings table: Product → Still Life, add AI row
- [x] Update hero image rule: all variants now use `foundation-1.jpg` as subtle background
- [x] Commit: `chore: update CLAUDE.md for Phase 6 changes`

### Phase 7 — Client Edit Round 2 [x]
> Goal: investigate and prepare second round of client-requested visual fixes. Do not apply code changes until approved.

**Gallery — AI filter layout:**
- [x] Root cause: all 4 AI images are `768x1344`, very tall portrait images. Current `GalleryGrid` uses CSS columns/masonry (`columns-3`), which balances column heights instead of forcing row-by-row placement.
- [x] With 4 equal-height tall items in 3 masonry columns, the browser can visually distribute them as 2 stacked images in one column and 2 stacked images in another, leaving the third column empty. This makes the AI filter look like 2 images per row even though the 3-column style exists.
- [x] Fix: switch `GalleryGrid` from CSS columns to CSS grid (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) so the AI filter shows 3 images on the first row and 1 image on the second row.
- [x] Tradeoff: CSS grid forces row-based layout and may reduce the masonry height variation that other gallery filters currently have.
- [x] Alternative considered: keep masonry and add more AI images so the 3-column masonry distribution has enough items to fill out naturally.

**Hero background image visibility:**
- [x] Current issue: `public/images/cosmetics/foundation-1.jpg` is too invisible at the current subtle opacity (`opacity-[0.12]`).
- [x] Fix: increase hero background opacity to `opacity-[0.32]`.
- [x] Add an image-layer fade/mask toward the bottom so the image remains more visible through the main hero area but becomes more hidden behind the bottom gradient / large "Grang Studio" text area.

**V1 dark mode text contrast:**
- [x] Current issue: "Photography & Video Direction" in V1 dark mode is almost invisible because the font is thin and the muted color reads too faint.
- [x] Current issue: the small "Photography" label above the filter buttons and inactive filter button text are also too invisible in V1 dark mode.
- [x] Fix: update V1 dark mode muted text color from `#999999` to `#C0C0C0`.
- [x] Fix: update V1 dark mode line/border color from `#1A1A1A` to `#333333` so inactive filter buttons have clearer borders.
- [x] Ensure light/dark theme changes continue to use appropriate gray values per theme instead of one fixed color.

**Info section typography:**
- [x] Increase info section font sizes, including Photographer & Video Director, email, phone number, and Instagram handle.
- [x] Commit: `fix: phase 7 client edit round 2`

## Notes

- `notion_export/` is source-only — never import from it directly in the app
- All UI text in English; Korean appears only in alt text or metadata where helpful for SEO
- The studio name "Grang Studio" comes from 봉사활동 동아리 그랑 (volunteer club "Grang") which Bosun ran 2015–2022 — it's personal and meaningful
- `npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin` run this for vercel plugin. also check for other mcp server or any add ons that would help for this project managment.
